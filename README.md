# architect_example

Bloc pattern architecture example. The game UI is just for visual pleasure, you can imagine it as
a regular application, not a game.

Most of things in the code are made in a more difficult way than it should be in a real application
to show an ability to implement it in different ways.

The goal of the application is to show architecture skills.

Pattern: UI - Bloc - Services - Repository - API
